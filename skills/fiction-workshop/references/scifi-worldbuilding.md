# Sci-Fi Worldbuilding Reference

Genre-specific guidance for hard science fiction and near-future techno-thrillers.

## The Hard SF Promise

Readers of hard SF expect:
- **Scientific accuracy**: The physics should work (or be acknowledged as extrapolation)
- **Technical competence**: Characters understand their domain
- **Logical consequences**: "If this technology exists, then..."
- **The cool factor**: Science itself as source of wonder and terror
- **Human stakes**: Technology matters because people are affected

## Worldbuilding Principles

### The One Big Lie
Hard SF typically allows one major extrapolation from current science:
- Your "lie": The one thing you're speeding up, exaggerating, or inventing
- Everything else should flow from real science
- Explain why reality differs from current models (this can be your thriller hook)

### Iceberg Worldbuilding
Know 10x more than you show:
- Deep research enables confident, specific prose
- Details emerge naturally through character perspective
- Avoids the "info-dump" problem
- Readers trust authors who clearly understand the subject

### Technology as Character
In techno-thrillers, systems have personalities:
- What can your technology do brilliantly?
- Where does it fail or require human judgment?
- What are the edge cases that create drama?

## Example: Applying Hard SF Principles

### The Science Foundation Pattern

For any hard SF thriller, establish:

**Real-World Base**
- Start with current scientific understanding or technology
- Identify the actual limitations and challenges
- Research what's plausible in near-term (5-20 years)

**The One Big Lie**
- What's your extrapolation? (faster timeline, new discovery, scaled-up tech)
- Justify it within the story (this can be your thriller hook)
- Everything else flows from real science

**Technology Capabilities and Limits**
- What can the technology do brilliantly?
- Where does it fail or require human judgment?
- What are maintenance/fuel/power constraints?
- What legal/political frameworks govern its use?

### Infrastructure Dependencies

Build cascading consequences:
1. Identify systems that depend on your technology
2. Show secondary failures (what breaks when X fails?)
3. Include familiar touchpoints (reader's daily life affected)
4. Escalate from inconvenience to catastrophe

Show domino effects that make stakes visceral to readers.

### Geopolitical Reality

**Institutional Landscape**
- Which agencies/organizations have jurisdiction?
- What are the formal legal frameworks?
- Who controls access and permissions?
- Where do private companies fit?

**Conflict Vectors**
- Resource competition (who gets saved/sacrificed?)
- National security concerns
- Legal liability and responsibility
- Information asymmetry and trust

## Technical Prose Craft

### The Competence Cascade
Show expertise through:
- Characters using jargon naturally (then briefly contextualizing for readers)
- Problem-solving that reveals understanding
- Awareness of edge cases and failure modes
- Disagreement between experts about approach

### Avoiding Info-Dumps
Instead of explaining the science:
- Character makes a calculation under pressure
- Consequences of getting it wrong are immediate
- Reader learns through story stakes

**Weak:**
> "The thermal expansion coefficient of the alloy means it will fail at 400 degrees. That's why the containment breach happened so quickly."

**Strong:**
> "Twenty minutes," Chen said, running the numbers again. "That's all we have before the temperature hits critical."
> "Can we cool it faster?"
> "I know." She didn't look up. "That's why I said twenty minutes and not thirty."

### The Detail Hierarchy

**Must be accurate:**
- Core physics of the premise
- Technology your characters use extensively
- Geography and institutional structures

**Should be plausible:**
- Near-future extrapolations
- Political responses
- Economic consequences

**Can be handwaved:**
- Minor technical details
- Background systems not central to plot
- Exact dates and timelines (near-future flexibility)

## Pacing Technical Material

### Front-Load Orientation
Early chapters: establish normal operations, introduce the technology
- Reader learns the vocabulary alongside the stakes
- Use training/routine to show competence
- The cascade begins only after reader understands what's being lost

### Escalation Through Detail
As stakes rise, technical detail should:
- Get more specific (this unit, this intersection point)
- Show systems failing in sequence
- Narrow the options

### The "Martian" Model
Technical problem-solving as tension:
1. Problem presented (crisis in 6 hours)
2. Character attempts solution (technical intervention)
3. Complication (resource shortage, political obstacle)
4. Adapted solution (creative technical workaround)
5. Outcome (success with cost, or failure leading to next problem)

## Research Integration

### For any hard SF thriller, verify:
- Current state of the technology/science
- Real-world analogues and case studies
- Institutional structures and jurisdictions
- Cost and timeline realities
- Legal and regulatory frameworks
- Industry economics and incentives
- Expert consensus and disagreements

### Expert Consultation Prep
Effective questions for domain experts:
- What would accelerate [scenario] beyond current models?
- What's the realistic response timeline for [crisis]?
- How do national security/commercial concerns affect cooperation?
- What keeps you up at night about this area?
- What do outsiders always get wrong?

## Common Hard SF Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Lecture mode | Conflict carries information |
| "As you know, Bob" | Characters learn, readers learn with them |
| Magic technology | Show limitations and costs |
| Ignoring economics | Space operations are expensive—use this |
| Universal competence | Characters have specialties and blind spots |
| Ignoring politics | Geopolitics is half the thriller |
| Forgetting humans | Technology should reveal character |
