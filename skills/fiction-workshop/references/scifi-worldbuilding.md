# Sci-Fi Worldbuilding Reference

Genre-specific guidance for hard science fiction and near-future techno-thrillers.

## The Hard SF Promise

Readers of hard SF expect:
- **Scientific accuracy**: The physics should work (or be acknowledged as extrapolation)
- **Technical competence**: Characters understand their domain
- **Logical consequences**: "If this technology exists, then..."
- **The cool factor**: Science itself as source of wonder and terror
- **Human stakes**: Technology matters because people are affected

## Worldbuilding Principles

### The One Big Lie
Hard SF typically allows one major extrapolation from current science:
- Your "lie": The one thing you're speeding up, exaggerating, or inventing
- Everything else should flow from real science
- Explain why reality differs from current models (this can be your thriller hook)

### Iceberg Worldbuilding
Know 10x more than you show:
- Deep research enables confident, specific prose
- Details emerge naturally through character perspective
- Avoids the "info-dump" problem
- Readers trust authors who clearly understand the subject

### Technology as Character
In techno-thrillers, systems have personalities:
- What can the ADR technology do brilliantly?
- Where does it fail or require human judgment?
- What are the edge cases that create drama?

## Example: Orbital Debris Thriller

### The Science Foundation

**Kessler Syndrome (Real Phenomenon)**
- Orbital debris collides → creates more debris → cascading collisions
- Current tracking: ~30,000 objects > 10cm
- Collision velocity: ~10-15 km/s (catastrophic)
- Debris can remain in orbit for centuries (LEO) to forever (higher orbits)

**Potential Accelerated Timeline**
- Need scientific justification for faster cascade
- Options: larger initial event, previously unknown debris population, resonant orbital mechanics
- This justification can be revealed as part of thriller plot

**Active Debris Removal (ADR) Technologies**
Real and near-term options:
- Robotic arms (capture and deorbit)
- Nets and harpoons (for tumbling objects)
- Electrodynamic tethers (drag enhancement)
- Laser ablation (gentle push)
- Ion beam shepherd (contactless)

Challenges:
- Each piece of debris has different rotation, trajectory
- Fuel/power limitations
- Rendezvous is hard
- Legal: debris belongs to launching nation

### Infrastructure Dependencies

Build the cascade of failures:
1. **GPS** (military, navigation, timing)
2. **Weather satellites** (forecasting, agriculture, aviation)
3. **Communications** (TV, internet backbone, disaster response)
4. **Earth observation** (climate monitoring, intelligence)
5. **Banking/finance** (timing synchronization)
6. **Aviation** (GPS navigation, satellite comms)

Show domino effect as readers' familiar world degrades.

### Geopolitical Reality

**Space Law**
- Outer Space Treaty (1967): space is for all, no weapons of mass destruction
- Debris ownership: launcher retains responsibility/liability
- No one can remove another nation's debris without permission
- This creates the core thriller conflict

**Key Players**
- NASA / US Space Force
- ESA (European Space Agency)
- Roscosmos (Russia)
- CNSA (China)
- Private: SpaceX, Blue Origin, Astroscale, ClearSpace

**Conflict Vectors**
- Destroying a Russian rocket body = act of war?
- Whose satellite gets saved when you can only save one?
- Who pays for cleanup?
- Who gets the data on orbital positions?

## Technical Prose Craft

### The Competence Cascade
Show expertise through:
- Characters using jargon naturally (then briefly contextualizing for readers)
- Problem-solving that reveals understanding
- Awareness of edge cases and failure modes
- Disagreement between experts about approach

### Avoiding Info-Dumps
Instead of explaining orbital mechanics:
- Character makes a calculation under pressure
- Consequences of getting it wrong are immediate
- Reader learns physics through story stakes

**Weak:**
> "Orbital mechanics dictate that objects in lower orbits travel faster than those in higher orbits. This is why the debris cloud from the collision spread so quickly."

**Strong:**
> "Twenty minutes," Chen said, running the numbers again. "That's all we have before the primary cloud intersects Sector 7."
> "The secondaries are faster. Lower orbit."
> "I know." She didn't look up. "That's why I said twenty minutes and not thirty."

### The Detail Hierarchy

**Must be accurate:**
- Core physics of the premise (orbital mechanics, debris behavior)
- Technology your characters use extensively
- Geography and institutional structures

**Should be plausible:**
- Near-future extrapolations (improved ADR tech)
- Political responses
- Economic consequences

**Can be handwaved:**
- Minor technical details
- Background systems not central to plot
- Exact dates and timelines (near-future flexibility)

## Pacing Technical Material

### Front-Load Orientation
Early chapters: establish normal operations, introduce the technology
- Reader learns the vocabulary alongside the stakes
- Use training/routine to show competence
- The cascade begins only after reader understands what's being lost

### Escalation Through Detail
As stakes rise, technical detail should:
- Get more specific (this satellite, this conjunction)
- Show systems failing in sequence
- Narrow the options

### The "Martian" Model
Technical problem-solving as tension:
1. Problem presented (debris intersection in 6 hours)
2. Character attempts solution (rendezvous and deorbit)
3. Complication (fuel shortage, political obstacle)
4. Adapted solution (creative technical workaround)
5. Outcome (success with cost, or failure leading to next problem)

## Research Integration

### For orbital debris stories, verify:
- Current orbital debris population and tracking capabilities
- ADR missions (ClearSpace-1, Astroscale ELSA-d)
- Specific satellite infrastructure (GPS constellation layout)
- Launch costs and timelines
- International Space Station vulnerability
- Satellite insurance industry
- Military space command structures

### Expert Consultation Prep
Example questions for orbital debris experts:
- What would accelerate a cascade beyond current models?
- What's the realistic response timeline for an emergency ADR mission?
- How do national security concerns affect international cooperation?
- What keeps you up at night about this scenario?

## Common Hard SF Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Lecture mode | Conflict carries information |
| "As you know, Bob" | Characters learn, readers learn with them |
| Magic technology | Show limitations and costs |
| Ignoring economics | Space operations are expensive—use this |
| Universal competence | Characters have specialties and blind spots |
| Ignoring politics | Geopolitics is half the thriller |
| Forgetting humans | Technology should reveal character |
