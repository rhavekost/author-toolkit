# Continuity Tracking Reference

When invoked as "continuity tracker," focus on internal consistency of facts, timeline, and world rules.

## Categories of Continuity

### 1. Physical Continuity
- Character descriptions (eye color, height, scars, etc.)
- Object locations and states
- Setting details (room layout, geography)
- Weather and lighting across continuous scenes

### 2. Timeline Continuity
- Day/date tracking
- Character ages
- Duration of events
- "Meanwhile" coordination between POVs
- Historical references matching the setting's year

### 3. Character Continuity
- Knowledge states (what does each character know and when did they learn it?)
- Relationship status
- Emotional carryover from previous scenes
- Injuries, fatigue, hunger (physical states)

### 4. World Rules Continuity
- Technology limitations
- Magic system rules (if applicable)
- Social/political structures
- Economic realities

## Tracking Methods

### Story Bible Cross-Reference

Maintain or update these sections:
- **Character Registry**: Physical descriptions, relationships, knowledge states
- **Timeline**: Chapter-by-chapter date/time markers
- **World Facts**: Established rules and details
- **Object Tracking**: Important items, where they are, who has them

### Red Flag Patterns

Watch for:
- "She said" when only men are present
- Characters referring to information they haven't learned yet
- Time passing faster or slower than physical travel allows
- Characters in two places at once (parallel POVs)
- Objects appearing/disappearing without explanation

## Common Continuity Errors

| Category | Example | Prevention |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Physical | Blue eyes in Ch. 3, brown in Ch. 12 | First mention → story bible |
| Timeline | "Three days later" math doesn't add up | Build timeline document |
| Knowledge | Character references unlearned info | Track knowledge states |
| Geography | 10-minute walk becomes 2-hour drive | Map the setting |
| Wounds | Broken arm never mentioned again | Track injury recovery |
| Weather | Sunny morning, thunderstorm noon, sunny afternoon | Note weather at scene start |

## Audit Process

### Single Chapter Audit

1. List all facts stated or implied
2. Cross-reference against story bible
3. Flag contradictions
4. Flag new facts to add to bible

### Multi-Chapter Audit

1. Build timeline of events with chapter markers
2. Track character locations through timeline
3. Verify knowledge transfer logic (who told whom what)
4. Check "emotional math" (reactions matching prior events)

### Full Manuscript Audit

1. Character name/description consistency pass
2. Timeline construction and verification
3. Knowledge state mapping
4. World rule enforcement
5. Object/MacGuffin tracking

## Repair Strategies

### Minor Fixes
For small contradictions, usually fix the later occurrence to match the established fact.

### Major Fixes
When a contradiction is load-bearing:
1. Document both versions
2. Identify which serves the story better
3. Trace all dependencies on each version
4. Fix comprehensively (all instances)

### Retconning
Sometimes the "wrong" version is actually better. In that case:
1. Change all earlier references to match
2. Update story bible
3. Check for downstream effects

## Feedback Format

When flagging continuity issues:
1. Quote the contradiction (both instances with chapter markers)
2. Note which is earlier (thus "established")
3. Recommend which to change and why
4. Check for ripple effects
5. Update story bible if needed
