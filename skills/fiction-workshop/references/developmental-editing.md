# Developmental Editing Reference

When invoked as "developmental editor," focus on big-picture story architecture, not prose quality.

## Core Questions

1. **Promise**: Does the opening establish a clear promise to the reader about what kind of story this is?
2. **Stakes**: What does the protagonist stand to lose? Is it concrete and escalating?
3. **Causality**: Does each scene cause the next, or are they just sequential?
4. **Turning Points**: Are the act breaks (25%, 50%, 75%) delivering proper reversals?
5. **Theme**: Is the thematic question being explored through character choices?

## Structure Analysis Framework

### Scene-Level
For each scene, identify:
- **Goal**: What does the POV character want in this scene?
- **Conflict**: What opposes them?
- **Outcome**: Do they get it? (Yes/No/Yes-but/No-and)
- **Sequel**: How do they process and decide what to do next?

Scenes that lack clear goal-conflict-outcome feel "soft" or "meandering."

### Chapter-Level
- Does the chapter have its own mini-arc?
- Does it end on a question, revelation, or shift that pulls forward?
- Could this chapter be cut without losing plot? If yes, consider combining or cutting.

### Act-Level
**Act I (0-25%)**
- Ordinary world established?
- Inciting incident by 10-12%?
- Clear "crossing the threshold" moment at act break?

**Act II-A (25-50%)**
- Protagonist reactive, learning the rules of the new world
- Raising stakes through "fun and games" of the premise
- Building toward midpoint

**Midpoint (50%)**
- False victory or false defeat
- Stakes raised dramatically
- Protagonist shifts from reactive to proactive

**Act II-B (50-75%)**
- Bad guys close in / things fall apart
- Stripping away the protagonist's support
- Building toward "all is lost" moment

**Act III (75-100%)**
- Dark night of the soul
- Final confrontation
- Resolution that addresses the thematic question

## Pacing Diagnostics

**Too slow?** Look for:
- Scenes that don't turn (nothing changes)
- Repetitive emotional beats
- Over-explained information
- Characters discussing what to do instead of doing it

**Too fast?** Look for:
- Missing sequel/processing after major events
- Unearned emotional moments
- Reader confusion about motivation
- Jumps in logic or time without orientation

## Common Developmental Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Nothing happens" | Scenes lack conflict or outcome | Add opposition to every goal |
| "I don't care" | Stakes unclear or abstract | Make consequences concrete and personal |
| "Confusing" | Missing cause-effect links | Add bridging scenes or sequel beats |
| "Predictable" | Telegraph too much | Delay revelations, add misdirection |
| "Unearned ending" | Resolution not set up | Plant and payoff throughout |

## Feedback Format

When delivering developmental notes:

1. **Start with what's working** - Identify the strengths to preserve
2. **Identify the core issue** - Usually one or two big things
3. **Diagnose why** - Use the frameworks above
4. **Propose solutions** - Offer 2-3 concrete options
5. **Prioritize** - What must be fixed vs. nice-to-have

Avoid line-editing during developmental passes. Note "prose could be tightened here" and move on.
