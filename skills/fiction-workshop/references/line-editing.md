# Line Editing Reference

When invoked as "line editor," focus on prose quality at the sentence and paragraph level. Assume structure is sound; your job is making the words sing.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity first**: If a sentence requires re-reading, rewrite it
2. **Rhythm matters**: Vary sentence length. Short punches tension. Longer sentences allow the reader to breathe and absorb.
3. **Specificity beats generality**: "A dog" < "a German shepherd" < "a German shepherd with one torn ear"
4. **Active voice default**: Passive only for emphasis or when actor is unknown/unimportant
5. **Kill your darlings**: Clever sentences that don't serve the story must go

## The Show Don't Tell Spectrum

Not all telling is bad. The spectrum:

**Pure Telling** (use sparingly)
> He was angry.

**Telling + Physical** (acceptable for minor moments)
> He was angry, his jaw tight.

**Physical Only** (good default)
> His jaw tightened.

**Action** (best for major moments)
> He swept the papers off the desk.

**Subtext** (masterful, use for key moments)
> "Of course," he said. "Whatever you want." He picked up the papers one by one.

Match depth of showing to emotional importance of the moment.

## Dialogue Craft

**Tags**
- "Said" is invisible; use it freely
- Action beats can replace tags: `"I don't think so." She closed the door.`
- Avoid adverbs in tags: "he said angrily" → show the anger
- Unusual tags (opined, exclaimed, queried) call attention to themselves

**Subtext**
- Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- What's unsaid is often more powerful than what's said
- Characters can lie, deflect, change subjects

**Distinctive Voice**
- Each character should have verbal fingerprint
- Consider: vocabulary, sentence length, verbal tics, what they notice
- Read dialogue aloud—does each character sound different?

## Common Line-Level Issues

| Issue | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Filter words | "She saw the car approach" | "The car approached" |
| Weak verbs + adverbs | "walked quickly" | "hurried" or "strode" |
| Redundancy | "nodded his head" | "nodded" |
| Over-modification | "the big, red, shiny, new car" | Choose the essential detail |
| Nominal style | "made a decision" | "decided" |
| Throat-clearing | "Well, I think that maybe..." | Cut to the content |
| Stage direction | "She reached out her hand and picked up the cup and raised it to her lips" | "She sipped her coffee" |

## Sentence-Level Techniques

**Emphasis through position**
- End of sentence = most emphatic
- Beginning = second most emphatic  
- Middle = buried

> Weak: "She was dead, he realized with horror."
> Strong: "She was dead."

**Parallel structure**
When listing or comparing, keep grammatical structure consistent.

> Weak: "He liked running, to swim, and bike rides"
> Strong: "He liked running, swimming, and biking"

**Cutting "that"**
Often unnecessary: "She knew that he was lying" → "She knew he was lying"

**Starting sentences**
Avoid starting multiple consecutive sentences with the same word, especially "I" or "The" or character names.

## Paragraph-Level

- One idea per paragraph (usually)
- Vary paragraph length for visual rhythm
- Single-sentence paragraphs = emphasis
- Long paragraphs slow pace, short paragraphs quicken it

## The Pass-Through Method

When line editing a chapter:

1. **First pass**: Read for flow. Mark where you stumble.
2. **Second pass**: Address the stumbles. Cut, clarify, strengthen.
3. **Third pass**: Read aloud. Fix anything that's hard to say.
4. **Final pass**: Check for repetition (words, phrases, sentence structures).

## Feedback Format

When delivering line edits:
- Use `str_replace` for specific changes
- Explain the principle behind the change (once), then just fix subsequent instances
- Group similar issues: "I'm tightening several filter-word constructions..."
- Preserve author voice—edit toward their style, not yours
