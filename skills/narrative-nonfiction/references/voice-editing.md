# Voice Editing Reference

Maintaining consistent authorial voice and tone in narrative nonfiction.

## Voice in Self-Help

Your voice is why readers trust you. It should feel:
- **Consistent**: Same person chapter to chapter
- **Authentic**: Like you actually talk (elevated, but recognizable)
- **Appropriate**: Matching your topic and audience
- **Distinctive**: Not generic self-help paste

## Defining Your Voice

### Voice Dimensions

Rate your book's intended voice on these spectrums:

**Formality**
Academic |---|---|---|---| Conversational

**Warmth**
Professional |---|---|---|---| Intimate

**Authority**
Peer |---|---|---|---| Expert

**Seriousness**
Grave |---|---|---|---| Playful

**Directness**
Hedged |---|---|---|---| Blunt

### Example Voice Profile (Career Development Book)

- Formality: 2.5/5 (professional but approachable)
- Warmth: 3/5 (supportive, realistic, no false promises)
- Authority: 4/5 (experience-based expertise, earned credibility)
- Seriousness: 3.5/5 (serious goals, pragmatic tone)
- Directness: 4/5 (straight talk, clear frameworks, actionable)

**In practice, this sounds like:**
- "Let's be honest—that promotion isn't going to happen by accident."
- "Here's what actually works: visibility plus value delivery."
- "You just navigated a difficult conversation. That's leadership."

## Voice Elements

### Sentence Patterns
Does this author use:
- Short punchy sentences? Or flowing complex ones?
- Fragments for emphasis?
- Questions to the reader?
- Lists and parallel structure?

### Vocabulary Choices
- Formal or informal words? (utilize vs. use)
- Jargon or accessible language?
- Specific or abstract terms?
- Profanity (yes/no/how much)?

### Reader Address
- "You" (direct) or "we" (collaborative) or "one" (distant)?
- How often do you directly address the reader?
- Rhetorical questions?

### Self-Reference
- First person presence (how much "I")?
- Personal stories frequency?
- Expert positioning or peer positioning?

### Humor
- Irony and wit?
- Self-deprecation?
- Absurdist observations?
- Pop culture references?

## Example Voice Markers (Permission-Giving Self-Help)

### DO use:
- Direct "you" address
- Short declarative sentences for key points
- Rhetorical questions that lead to answers
- Light profanity where it punches ("damn right you can")
- Personal stories of recovery (past tense—author has done the work)
- Permission-giving language ("you're allowed," "it's okay," "here's permission")

### DON'T use:
- Academic jargon
- Passive voice for advice
- Excessive hedging ("perhaps you might consider")
- Shame language (even subtle)
- Comparison to others
- "Should" without alternatives

### Voice Examples

**On-voice:**
> "You've spent years being the reliable one. The one who says yes. The one who makes everyone comfortable. And you're exhausted.
> 
> Good news: you're allowed to stop."

**Off-voice:**
> "Many individuals find themselves in positions where they consistently prioritize others' needs. This pattern, while perhaps stemming from positive intentions, can lead to burnout. It may be beneficial to consider alternative approaches."

The second is accurate but sounds like a different book.

## Voice Consistency Checklist

### Per Chapter Review

- [ ] Does this sound like the same author as Chapter 1?
- [ ] Is the reader address consistent (you/we/I pattern)?
- [ ] Are the vocabulary choices consistent?
- [ ] Is the humor/seriousness ratio consistent?
- [ ] Is the metaphor voice consistent?

### Common Drift Patterns

**Formality creep**: Getting more academic as content gets complex
- Fix: Rewrite complex ideas in conversational language

**Energy drop**: Later chapters feel flatter
- Fix: Inject voice moments, especially openings

**Hedging increase**: More qualifiers appearing
- Fix: Edit out hedges, commit to claims

**Metaphor abandonment**: Forgetting the frame in content-heavy chapters
- Fix: Add metaphor callbacks to each chapter

## Voice Repairs

### Sentence-Level Fixes

**Too formal:**
> "It is important to recognize that focused work sessions are essential for meaningful productivity."

**Repaired:**
> "Here's the truth: you can't multitask your way to deep work. Pick one thing."

**Too hedged:**
> "You might find that limiting distractions can sometimes lead to better focus."

**Repaired:**
> "Turn off notifications. Try it for two hours. (Spoiler: the world keeps spinning.)"

**Too distant:**
> "One should consider the long-term implications of chronic reactive work habits."

**Repaired:**
> "You've been in reactive mode for years. You know where it leads."

### Paragraph-Level Fixes

If a paragraph drifts off-voice:
1. Identify the core point
2. Ask: How would I explain this to a friend?
3. Rewrite from that conversational place
4. Add back necessary precision

### Chapter-Level Fixes

If a whole chapter feels off:
1. Read Chapter 1 aloud to reset the voice
2. Re-read the problem chapter
3. Mark every sentence that doesn't sound like you
4. Rewrite those sentences
5. Check transitions—often voice breaks at section shifts

## Voice and Emotional Moments

### When to Dial Up Warmth

- When asking reader to do hard things
- When discussing painful experiences
- When the reader might feel shame
- When delivering the reveal/reframe

### When to Dial Up Directness

- When giving core advice
- When combating reader's self-deception
- When the central metaphor is key to understanding
- When permission needs to be unambiguous

### When to Dial Back Humor

- During genuinely painful examples
- When stakes are high (reader's safety, serious situations)
- In the reveal chapter—humor too early undercuts emotion

## Testing Voice

### The Read-Aloud Test
Read a passage aloud. Does it sound like you talking?

### The Attribution Test
Cover the book title. Would a reader know this is you?

### The Consistency Test
Read Chapter 1 and Chapter 12 back-to-back. Same person?

### The Beta Reader Test
Ask: "What's this author like?" Answers should match your intended voice.
