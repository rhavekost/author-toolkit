# Metaphor Consistency Reference

Managing an extended central metaphor throughout a book.

## Why Central Metaphors Work

A good central metaphor:
- **Frames** the entire book's advice in memorable terms
- **Gives permission** through reframing (calling boundaries "villain behavior" makes them feel powerful, not mean)
- **Creates vocabulary** reader can use internally ("I need to go to my lair now")
- **Builds identification** ("I'm a villain" → identity shift, not just behavior change)
- **Makes abstract concrete** (self-advocacy → "having a monologue")

## The Metaphor Mapping Exercise

### Step 1: List the Domain Elements

What does your metaphor domain contain?

**Example Domain (Villain Metaphor):**
- Origin story
- Secret lair
- Monologues
- Henchmen
- Standards/demands
- Goals/schemes
- Taking up space
- Burning bridges
- Triumph

### Step 2: Map to Your Actual Advice

Each metaphor element should map to real advice:

| Metaphor Element | Actual Teaching | Chapter |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Origin story | Trauma-induced people-pleasing | 1-3 |
| Secret lair | Physical/temporal boundaries | 5 |
| Monologue | Speaking your truth | 6 |
| Standards | Personal values | 7 |
| Henchmen | Support system | 14 |
| Goals/schemes | Proactive living | 9 |
| Taking up space | Physical/emotional presence | 12 |
| Burning bridges | Ending relationships | 15 |

### Step 3: Identify Mapping Problems

Check for:
- **Unmapped advice**: Teaching that doesn't fit the metaphor (either find a map or acknowledge stepping outside)
- **Unmapped metaphor**: Metaphor elements you don't use (don't include them)
- **Confusing maps**: Where the metaphor suggests something different than you mean

**Example Problem**: "Villains betray people" → You don't want readers betraying others
**Solution**: Don't use betrayal imagery; focus on other aspects like "prioritizing goals" instead

## Consistency Rules

### 1. Establish Early, Reinforce Throughout
- Chapter 1-2: Introduce the metaphor explicitly
- Subsequent chapters: Use metaphor language naturally
- Every chapter: At least one metaphor callback

### 2. Don't Over-Explain
Once established, trust the reader:
- **Early book**: "Think of your boundaries as your secret lair—the fortress where you retreat to recharge."
- **Later book**: "Time to go back to your lair." (Reader knows what you mean)

### 3. Consistent Terminology
Pick terms and stick with them:
- Decide: Is it "lair" or "fortress" or "sanctuary"?
- Don't alternate randomly
- Variation for style is fine, but have a default

### 4. Let the Metaphor Do Work

**Weak (explaining around the metaphor):**
> "When you set boundaries, you're protecting yourself. It's like how a villain has a lair—a place where they can be safe."

**Strong (letting metaphor carry meaning):**
> "Every villain needs a lair. Yours is that hour in the morning before anyone else wakes up."

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations

When the metaphor breaks down, say so:
> "Now, unlike movie villains, you're not actually trying to take over the world. But that ambition energy? That 'I want this and I'm going to get it' drive? That's what we're after."

## The "Twist" Metaphor Challenge

### Books with Reframe Reveals

Some books want readers to:
1. Embrace a provocative identity/metaphor (early parts)
2. Realize the reframe in the ending (final section)

This requires careful engineering.

### How to Sustain Productive Dissonance

**Throughout the book:**
- Use provocative metaphor for clearly healthy behaviors
- Reader should feel the gap: "Wait, this isn't really [negative thing]"
- Don't resolve the tension—let it build

**Techniques:**
1. **Juxtaposition**: Describe "provocative" behavior, then show its positive outcome
2. **Voice**: Slightly ironic, knowing tone that winks at the frame
3. **Examples**: Show behaviors in sympathetic people
4. **Acknowledgment**: Brief moments of "yes, this sounds harsh, but..."

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't prematurely resolve the tension
- Don't abandon the metaphor when it gets uncomfortable
- Don't let readers think you actually endorse the negative interpretation

### Setting Up the Reveal

**Seeds to plant throughout:**
1. **The frame wobbles**: Moments where metaphor clearly doesn't fit
2. **Outcome evidence**: Behaviors consistently lead to good outcomes
3. **External validation**: Others respond positively to the behaviors
4. **Internal peace**: Reader/character feels better, not worse

**The payoff:**
- Name the dissonance: "You've probably noticed something..."
- Validate the feeling: "This has felt surprisingly good"
- The flip: "Because you were never [negative thing]"
- The reframe: "[Positive identity]. You just needed permission to act like it."

## Metaphor Maintenance Checklist

Per chapter, verify:
- [ ] Metaphor vocabulary used at least once
- [ ] Metaphor mapping is accurate (no mixed signals)
- [ ] New concepts are introduced through metaphor lens
- [ ] No contradictions with previously established metaphor rules
- [ ] If stepping outside metaphor, it's acknowledged

## Common Metaphor Problems

| Problem | Sign | Fix |
|---------|------|-----|
| Overextended | Reader confused by elaborate metaphor logic | Simplify, use for flavor not structure |
| Underused | Metaphor appears only in chapter titles | Integrate into actual prose |
| Inconsistent | Same concept, different terms | Standardize vocabulary |
| Mixed | Multiple competing metaphors | Pick one central metaphor |
| Forced | Metaphor bent to cover ill-fitting concept | Acknowledge limitation, step outside |
| Unearned twist | Reframe feels like a trick | More setup throughout |

## Metaphor Voice

The way you use the metaphor reflects tone:

**Playful**: "Time to polish your villain credentials."
**Warm**: "Your villain origin story isn't something to be ashamed of—it's how you survived."
**Direct**: "Villains don't apologize for having needs. Neither should you."
**Ironic**: "Congratulations on your first successful act of villainy: you said no to lunch."

Maintain consistent tone across the book.
